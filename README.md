# MySFPal Application Builds
This is a proof-of-concept more than anything else.

# Introduction
MySFPal is your toolbox to interact with multiple Salesforce instance from a single application.
As a Salesforce Admin user, I have often use different tools & plugins to connect and interact with 
all my customer instance (from development, integration,acceptance & production sandbox).

## Why ?
I wanted a tool to easily repeat the same task over differents sandbox in a simple and easy way without 
the hassle to provide credentials or remember the multitude parameters to provide to the SFDX command line. 

## How ?
This tool is heavily relying on [sfdx|https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli], [jsForce|https://jsforce.github.io/] & [Gulp Tasks|https://gulpjs.com/]
