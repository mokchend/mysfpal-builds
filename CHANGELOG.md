# Change Logs
* v0.9.6 2021-05-09
  * Refactor & modularize code (log4j, sfdx command executor)
  * Optimize call to open an URL without using calling sfdx
  * Document usage/use case based on feedbacks from CSG collegue 
  * Add support to monitor Scratch & Non ScratchOrg
  * ASAR packaging is finally working: use the builderOptions.extraResources to package the needed assets outside the ASAR file
  * Adding sfdx-cli version in the LoggedAs component
  * Remove npm sfdx-cli dependancy as production build not able to call this command line. Workaround is to try auto-discover the SFDX installation. Advantage is that Build size reduce from 50Mb. __TO_BE_IMPROVED__ 


* v0.9.5 2021-05-06
  * Ubuntu, Mac OSX, Windows VM to handle the build the factory - __TODO__ : trigger a WebHook to build on code commit, check how to bundle Linux build
  * Support a clean (e.g no sfdx aliases defined) in your OS, Hide Menu Item when no alias defined
  * Add support Development Build versus Production Build - __TODO__ : pluginOptions.electronBuilder.builderOptions.asar = false : not recommended build, but having issue to use program defined in node_modules when use ASAR bundle. Drawback is that build process is slower but solve the needs to have sfdx ou gulp installed by the end user.
  (asar usage is disabled â€” this is strongly not recommended  solution=enable asar and use asarUnpack to unpack files that must be externally available)
  * Refactor the way sfdx commands are called as behavior from Development or Production Build are not working the same way (differents path execution). Needs to complexify the code to handle this situation. __TODO__ : Find a better way to implement it
  * Automatic application update when publishing a new version
  * Centralized log, improve error handling (a virgin OS: Mac & Windows) to catch/trap unhandled errors
  * Update About vue form to display if we are in Development or Production Build.
  * __WARNING__: Move local files/backups/workspace zone to __$HOME/data01__, consistent location on ALL OS : __$HOME/mysfpal.log__ and __$HOME/mysfpal-config.json__ to avoid zero configuration from the end user and ease the integration (__TODO__: Rework on C:\Users\cmok\AppData\Roaming\MySFPal\config.json)

  * Add jsforce Api version support: update globally the json config when alias is selected 
  * __TODO__ : Synch sfdx apiVersion and jsforce apiVersion to have a consistent experience & results
  * __TODO__ : Improve Gulp Task to signal the end of the task to the main process
